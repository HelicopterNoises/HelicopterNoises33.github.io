	Hello dear user of the internet, I present to you: A bunch of words on a screen!
This blog is about a stupid figment of my imagination, a medium sized city of around 600K, which I call Janac. (Map coming soon) <br>
<!-- insert map of Janac -->
Janac is a declining port city full of car-oriented suburban sprawl, with large congested highways inefficiently connecting suburbs to downtown, and public transportation dysfunctional and mostly nonexistent. Walkabillity and bikabillity? Janac's never heard of that! <br>
So, Janac summarizes most present day cities in the United States and Canada. Janac is Just Another North American City. <br>
Or is it? <br>
Because Janac's fictional city planners and governmental officials have begun to get some ideas... <br>
In this blog, I’m going to “fix” Janac with realistic, existing methods, while exploring public transportation and urban planning concepts, like efficient transit networks or walkability, and connect my concepts and ideas to cities that… actually exist. I will also talk about Janac's fictional past, and reflect on how North American cities used to be just like European ones, and how they have downgraded into the state they are in today. This blog will also explore both feasible and infeasible solutions, how politics and people can, have, and will play into all of this, and see how we can reclaim our cities from our cars, back to our people.
Welcome to Just Another North American City.

	<h1> Blog Updates </h1>
	<h2> x/xx/xx </h2>
	<p>Janac has launched! First post coming... sometime? <br>
	The graphics and designs on this blog are imcomplete, future revamps on the home page are planned - New logo, maps, etc. <br> I apologise for the mediocre appearence of the site as I attempt to learn how to git gud - CSS is HARD, and while I might have a great idea of what my site should look like, it's hard to make that actually happen. So no, Cedric Graphics are not coming soon, but maybe eventually. <br>
	And for some of you, welcome to The Providence Planner 2.0!!!
	</p>
	<p> Note that this blog will NEVER be "done". I will continue to mess around with site graphics and structure, upload new posts even if I "finish" the timeline, and even update and enhance posts I have already completed, all for as long as JANAC will exist. I can never be perfect, but I still would like to try... <br> So if you have any comments, feedback, or suggestions, feel free to let me know! An actual contact and/or discussion page will be made eventually, but for now, cedric.ye9@gmail.com works fine. <br>
	Thank you for visiting my website and checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy my (future) content! </p>
