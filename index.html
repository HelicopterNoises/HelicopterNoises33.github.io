	Hello dear user of the internet, I present to you: A bunch of words on a screen!
This blog is about a stupid figment of my imagination, a medium sized city of around 700K, which I call Janac. <br>
<!-- insert map of Janac -->
Janac is a declining city full of car-oriented urban sprawl, with large congested highways inefficiently connecting suburbs to downtown, and public transportation basically nonexistent. <br>
So, Janac summarizes most cities in the United States and Canada. Janac is Just Another North American City. <br>
Or is it? <br>
In this blog, I’m going to “fix” Janac with realistic, existing methods, while exploring public transportation and urban planning concepts, like efficient transit networks or walkability, and connect my concepts and ideas to cities that… actually exist. This blog will also explore both feasible and infeasible solutions, how politics and people can, have, and will, play into all of this, and see how we can reclaim our cities from the cars, back to the people.
Welcome to Just Another North American City.
